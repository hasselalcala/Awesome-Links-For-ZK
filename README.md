- [Improving Scalability and Privacy of Blockchains: 2022 Update on Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://medium.com/51nodes/improving-scalability-and-privacy-of-blockchains-2022-update-on-zero-knowledge-proofs-2d90615f0dd) An overview of current Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) implementations in the crypto space and discusses what to expect from ZKP as an exciting cryptographic method in the upcoming months and years. 

- [zk-SNARKs on Bitcoin](https://xiaohuiliu.medium.com/zk-snarks-on-bitcoin-239d96d182bd). Present the algorithms (key generation, prover and verifier) used in zk-SNARK.

- [How to create a Zero Knowledge DApp: From zero to production](https://vivianblog.hashnode.dev/how-to-create-a-zero-knowledge-dapp-from-zero-to-production#heading-zero-knowledge-structure). This is a step-by-step guide on how to build a Zero Knowledge (zk) Decentralized Application (DApp) from zero to production. The goal is to explain the flow of a zk dapp and deploy it so that users can use it.
