- [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty | WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c&t=14s). Computer scientist Amit Sahai, PhD, is asked to explain the concept of zero-knowledge proofs to 5 different people; a child, a teen, a college student, a grad student, and an expert. Using a variety of techniques, Amit breaks down what zero-knowledge proofs are and why it's so exciting in the world of cryptography.
